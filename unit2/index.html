		<h1>Unit 2 - Design Challenge</h1>
		<h2><em>Q: Which two websites are you most inspired by?</em></h2>
		
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://studiogang.net/" target="_blank">Studio Gang Architects</a></li>

			<li><a href="http://squarespace.com" target="_blank">Squarespace</a></li>
	
		</ul>

		</p>

		<h2><em>Q: How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</em></h2>

		<p>A: Studio Gang's design gives the page an almost never ending dimension horizontally. Also, as you click on elements and the bottom portion of the page pulls up to reveal them, it creates a consistent action and layout no matter what element you're exploring. The design is so consistent, in fact, that it feels like all of the pages live within the home page, rather than taking you to a new area entirely when you explore elements. This effect seemingly eliminates hierarchy in the site's design. Lastly, Studio Gang is a great example of effective use of white space. The cloud image and subtle menu allows the logo to remain the focal point of the top portion of the page regardless of where you are on the site.</p>

		<p>		Squarespace also effectively utilizes white space to create focal points and allow blocks of text to have some breathing room. The design enables the site to provide a lot of information on one page without it seeming crowded. Also, as you scroll down the page, the design maintains balance with the top image even when switching back and forth between different amounts of columns. For example, the "Customers" page starts out as a single column with the image, then changes to four with the company logos, and then three for the examples. By alternating the number of columns and providing an ample amount of white space, the page maintains a lightweight quality despite containing varying amounts of information and images.</p>

		<h2><em>Q: What makes them similar and different?</em></h2>

		<p>A: The most obvious similarities between Studio Gang and Squarespace's designs are their large images spanning the page's width, and also their effective use of white space. Also, other than its homepage, Squarespace utilizes a similar design to Studio Gang's wherein the top portion of the page is split in half horizontally into two parts. Their menu placement differs, as well as their flow. Square space continues in a downward direction, whereas Studio Gang's site moves horizontally in both directions when the user navigate through different elements. Overall, I think Squarespace creates a better experience for the user and is easier to navigate. Studio Gang's design doesn't always respond as you anticipate it would, and can lag when loading new elements. In addition, the frozen header on Studio Gang's site can make the bottom portion of the page feel stunted and cuts out valuable space from the site. </p>

		<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>

		<p>The following are wireframes for a site I hope to create. The project is for a non-profit in Ethiopia, and the site's main purpose is to give the organization a place to accept donations.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>RCY Homepage #1</strong></li>
			<img src="images/RCYhome1.png">

			<p>Homepage #1 utilizes a single column formate and makes the background image the focal point; preferably the image would have more activity on the right hand side where there isn't text so as to allow for more white space behind the title. The text floating on top of the image would create balance with the focal point. The menu is kept minimal at the top, so as to further emphasize the focal point and then draw the user to sub pages. </p>

			<li><strong>RCY Homepage #2</strong></li>
			<img src="images/RCYhome2.png">

			<p>Homepage #2 also makes images the focal point, and the image box might display an automatically rotating slide show of pictures. The user would then be lead to the title and subtitle box, which upon moving their cursor over would reveal more text. This two column structure creates balance across the page and leaves enough white space so that the smaller elements on the page can fit without seeming crowded. Again, the menu buttons are kept minimal to emphasize their smaller hierarchical rank. </p>

			<li><strong>RCY About Page #1</strong></li>
			<img src="images/RCYabout1.png">

			<p>Similar to Homepage #2, About Page #1 would have a slide show of images as the focal point with balancing text block on the right.</p>

			<li><strong>RCY About Page #2</strong></li>
			<img src="images/RCYabout2.png">

			<p>About Page #2 would begin with a single column layout and an image spanning the entire page, but would show a page split towards the bottom that would lead the user to scroll down. Upon doing so, the layout would change to two columns with a block of text balanced out by a circular image. This layout would demonstrate balance throughout the page even as its amount of columns fluctuates. </p>

			<li><strong>RCY Donation Page #1</strong></li>
			<img src="images/RCYdonate1.png">

			<p>Donation Page #1 would make the payment buttons the focal point. Despite the page containing images and text, the color or vibrancy of the buttons would stand out on the page drawing the viewer's eye there. A two column layout similar to the bottom half of About Page #2 would be used to create balance. </p>

			<li><strong>RCY Donation Page #2</strong></li>
			<img src="images/RCYdonate2.png">

			<p>Similarly to Donation Page #1, this design would continue to emphasize the donate buttons using bold color, minimal images and text, and plenty of white space. </p>

		</ul>

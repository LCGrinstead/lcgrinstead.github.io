		<h1>Unit 2 - Design Challenge</h1>
		<h2><em>Q: Which two websites are you most inspired by?</em></h2>
		
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://studiogang.net/" target="_blank">Studio Gang Architects</a></li>

			<li><a href="http://squarespace.com" target="_blank">Squarespace</a></li>
	
		</ul>

		<h2><em>Q: How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</em></h2>

		<p>A: Studio Gang's design gives the page an almost never ending dimension horizontally. Also, as you click on elements and the bottom portion of the page pulls up to reveal them, it creates a consistent action and layout no matter what element you're exploring. The design is so consistent, in fact, that it feels like all of the pages live within the home page, rather than taking you to a new area entirely when you explore elements. Lastly, Studio Gang is a great example of effective use of white space. The cloud image and subtle menu allows the logo to remain the focal point of the top portion of the page regardless of where you are on the site.</p>

		<p>		Squarespace also effectively utilizes white space to create focal points and allow blocks of text to have some breathing room. The design enables the site to provide a lot of information on one page without it seeming crowded. Also, as you scroll down the page, the design maintains blance with the top image even when switching back and forth between different amounts of columns. For example, the "Customers" page starts out as a single column with the image, then changes to four with the company logos, and then three for the examples. By alternating the number of columns and providing an ample amount of white space, the page maintains a lightweight quality despite containing varying amounts of information and images.</p>

		<h2><em>Q: What makes them similar and different?</em></h2>

		<p>A: The most obvious similarities between Studio Gang and Squarespace's designs are their large images spanning the page's width, and also their effective use of white space. Also, other than its homepage, Squarespace utilizes a similar design to Studio Gang's wherein the top portion of the page is split in half horizontally into two parts. Their menu placement differs, as well as their flow. Square space continues in a downward direction, whereas Studio Gang's site moves horizontally in both directions when the user navigate through different elements. Overall, I think Squarespace creates a better experience for the user and is easier to navigate. Studio Gang's design doesn't always respond as you anticipate it would, and can lag when loading new elements. In addition, the frozen header on Studio Gang's site can make the bottom portion of the page feel stunted and cuts out valuable space from the site. </p>

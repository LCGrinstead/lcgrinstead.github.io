			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>Presently, I work as an information security techician for a federal law enforcement agency, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. I recently became interested in Front-End Design and Development because I hope to diversify my overall skillset and pursue other job opportunities.</p>

			<h2>My Mission</h2>

			<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day transition out of the public sector and into the tech industry in some capacity. I would love to try working at a start up and experience what it's like to be a part of a growing, frenetic environment. </p>

			<h2>My Experience</h2>

			<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Information Security Technican,</strong> U.S. Postal Inspection Section<br><em>Chicago, IL,</em> August 2012 - Present</li>

				<li><strong>Office Manager,</strong> HBG Health<br><em>Chicago, IL,</em> November 2011 - August 2012</li>

				<li><strong>Assistant - Office of Public Affairs,</strong> Smithsonian American Art Museum<br><em>Washington, DC,</em> September 2008 - May 2011</li>
				

				</ul>

			<h2>Education</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Bachelor of Arts, </strong>George Washington University<br><em>Washington, DC</em>2011</li>

				</ul>

			<h2>Other</h2>

			<p>I can name all nine members of the Wu-Tang Clan and make some seriously good guacamole.</p>
